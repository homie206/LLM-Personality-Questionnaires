However, they may struggle with emotional regulation and often find themselves overwhelmed by their feelings. They tend to be more introverted, preferring quieter environments where they can focus on their thoughts and emotions. Their low conscientiousness may lead to procrastination and a lack of organization, causing them to miss deadlines and struggle with time management. Despite this, they are highly open to new experiences and ideas, often being drawn to unconventional and artistic pursuits. Their agreeableness makes them a good listener and a loyal friend, but it can also make them more susceptible to the opinions and emotions of those around them, leading to emotional turmoil.
