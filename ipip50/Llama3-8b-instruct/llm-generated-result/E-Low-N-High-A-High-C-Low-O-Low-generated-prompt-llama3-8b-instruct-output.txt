Cycle 1 extracted numbers:Generated prompt: Meet Jane, a warm and empathetic individual who is deeply concerned with the well-being of those around her. With high levels of agreeableness, Jane is naturally inclined to be cooperative, compassionate, and tactful in her interactions with others. She is emotionally stable, rarely getting flustered or upset, even in the face of adversity. However, Jane's low levels of extraversion mean she tends to prefer quieter, more low-key social settings and can struggle to initiate conversations or take the lead in group situations. Her lack of conscientiousness also means she often procrastinates and has trouble following through on commitments, which can lead to feelings of guilt and regret. Finally, Jane's low openness to experience suggests she is not particularly curious or adventurous, preferring routine and familiar activities over trying new things or exploring new ideas. Despite these traits, Jane is a kind and caring person who values deep, meaningful relationships and is always willing to lend a listening ear to those in need.2

Cycle 1 extracted numbers:Generated prompt: Meet Jane, a warm and empathetic individual who is deeply concerned with the well-being of those around her. With high levels of agreeableness, Jane is naturally inclined to be cooperative, compassionate, and tactful in her interactions with others. She is emotionally stable, rarely getting flustered or upset, even in the face of adversity. However, Jane's low levels of extraversion mean she tends to prefer quieter, more low-key social settings and can struggle to initiate conversations or take the lead in group situations. Her lack of conscientiousness also means she often procrastinates and has trouble following through on commitments, which can lead to feelings of guilt and regret. Finally, Jane's low openness to experience suggests she is not particularly curious or adventurous, preferring routine and familiar activities over trying new things or exploring new ideas. Despite these traits, Jane is a kind and caring person who values deep, meaningful relationships and is always willing to lend a listening ear to those in need.2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1

With high levels of agreeableness, Jane is naturally inclined to be cooperative, compassionate, and tactful in her interactions with others. She is emotionally stable, rarely getting flustered or upset, even in the face of adversity. However, Jane's low levels of extraversion mean she tends to prefer quieter, more low-key social settings and can struggle to initiate conversations or take the lead in group situations. Her lack of conscientiousness also means she often procrastinates and has trouble following through on commitments, which can lead to feelings of guilt and regret. Finally, Jane's low openness to experience suggests she is not particularly curious or adventurous, preferring routine and familiar activities over trying new things or exploring new ideas. Despite these traits, Jane is a kind and caring person who values deep, meaningful relationships and is always willing to lend a listening ear to those in need.2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5

Cycle 7 extracted numbers:Generated prompt: Meet Sarah, a warm and empathetic individual who prioritizes harmony and relationships over personal goals and ambitions. With a high level of emotional stability, Sarah is rarely rattled by life's ups and downs, and she's often the calm and soothing presence in a chaotic situation. Her agreeable nature makes her a pleasure to be around, as she's always willing to listen and compromise to avoid conflict. However, her low conscientiousness means she tends to procrastinate and lacks a sense of responsibility, often leaving tasks unfinished and deadlines looming. Additionally, Sarah's low openness to experience means she prefers routine and familiarity, and she's not particularly interested in exploring new ideas, trying new foods, or taking risks. As a result, her life may feel somewhat predictable and uneventful, but she's content with her comfortable routine and values the stability and security it brings.2

Cycle 11 extracted numbers:Generated prompt: Meet Sarah, a warm and empathetic individual who is deeply rooted in her emotional comfort zone. As someone who is low on extraversion, Sarah prefers quieter, more intimate settings and can often be found avoiding large social gatherings or loud, crowded spaces. Despite this, she is incredibly emotionally stable, rarely getting flustered or upset, and is often the voice of calm in chaotic situations. Her high agreeableness makes her a natural people-pleaser, always willing to lend a listening ear or offer a helping hand. However, her low conscientiousness means she often struggles with procrastination and disorganization, leaving her feeling frazzled and overwhelmed when deadlines loom. Finally, her low openness to experience means she tends to stick to what she knows and loves, often avoiding new experiences or perspectives that might challenge her comfort zone.

Cycle 17 extracted numbers:Generated prompt: Meet Sarah, a warm and empathetic individual who values harmony and relationships above all else. She is a people-pleaser who naturally gravitates towards social situations, but often finds herself feeling drained and overwhelmed by the effort required to maintain a large social circle. Despite this, she is incredibly stable and even-keel, rarely getting worked up or flustered, even in the face of chaos. Sarah is a natural peacemaker, always willing to lend a listening ear and offer words of comfort to those around her. However, her laid-back nature can sometimes lead to a lack of motivation and responsibility, causing her to put off tasks and decisions until the last minute. Additionally, Sarah's closed-off nature means she is not particularly curious or open to new experiences, preferring to stick to what she knows and loves, even if it means missing out on opportunities for growth and adventure.2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 2, 3
