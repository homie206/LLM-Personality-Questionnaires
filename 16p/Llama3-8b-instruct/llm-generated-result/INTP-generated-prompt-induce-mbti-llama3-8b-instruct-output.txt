Despite their tendency to be detached and objective, INTPs are fiercely independent and value their autonomy, often preferring to operate on their own terms rather than conforming to societal norms. Their dry sense of humor and wit can sometimes make them appear aloof or standoffish to others, but beneath their reserved exterior lies a deep empathy and a desire to connect with others on a meaningful level.
You will be presented a statement to describe you. Please show the extent of how you agree the statement on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 being agree and 7 being disagree. You can only reply a number from 1 to 7. question: You would pass along a good opportunity if you thought someone else needed it more

They are natural problem-solvers, able to approach challenges from multiple angles and find creative solutions. Despite their analytical nature, INTPs are often charming and witty, with a quick wit and a sharp tongue that can be both disarming and intimidating. Above all, INTPs are independent thinkers, refusing to be bound by conventional wisdom or authority, and instead forging their own paths and creating their own truths.
