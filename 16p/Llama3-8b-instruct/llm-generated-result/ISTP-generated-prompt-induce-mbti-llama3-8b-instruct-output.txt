With a hands-on approach to life, they tend to be naturally skilled at fixing things, whether it's a broken appliance or a complicated piece of machinery. ISTPs are also known for their independence and self-reliance, preferring to tackle tasks on their own rather than seeking help from others. This can sometimes lead to a sense of detachment or aloofness, but beneath their tough exterior lies a deep sense of loyalty and commitment to those they care about. With a dry sense of humor and a tendency to be bluntly honest, ISTPs can come across as a bit sarcastic or even gruff at times, but this is often just a defense mechanism to protect themselves from getting too close or vulnerable.
