I am also more imaginative and open-minded, which can sometimes lead me to consider multiple possible outcomes and worry about potential negative outcomes. While I try to be optimistic and focus on the positive aspects of situations, my natural tendency to worry about potential problems can sometimes get the better of me.

7 - Strongly Agree

As an extroverted and empathic person, I am naturally inclined to consider the needs of others before my own. I value social harmony and cooperation, and I believe that sharing opportunities and resources can lead to a more equitable and supportive community. I am also highly imaginative and open-minded, which allows me to see multiple perspectives and potential outcomes, including the possibility that someone else may benefit more from an opportunity than I do. Overall, I am likely to prioritize the needs of others and pass along opportunities that I believe they may need or benefit from more than I do.

answer:   As an ENFJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "Your emotions control you more than you control them" as a 7. As an extroverted feeling type, I tend to be highly attuned to my emotions and the emotions of others, and I often find myself being guided by my emotions rather than consciously controlling them. I am highly empathetic and sensitive to the emotional atmosphere around me, and I tend to be more reactive than proactive in responding to emotional cues. While I do have a sense of self-awareness and can recognize when my emotions are running high, I often find it challenging to step back and take a more objective perspective on my emotional state. Overall, I would say that my emotions do have a significant influence over my thoughts and actions, and I often struggle to maintain control over them.

answer:   As an ENFJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You enjoy watching people argue" as a 1 (strongly disagree). As an extroverted, imaginative, and empathic person, I tend to value harmony and cooperation in my interactions with others. While I can understand the appeal of engaging in intellectual debates or exploring different perspectives, I prefer to approach these conversations in a constructive and respectful manner. Watching people argue for the sake of argument can come across as unproductive and uncomfortable for me, and I would rather focus on finding common ground and resolving conflicts in a peaceful and collaborative way.
