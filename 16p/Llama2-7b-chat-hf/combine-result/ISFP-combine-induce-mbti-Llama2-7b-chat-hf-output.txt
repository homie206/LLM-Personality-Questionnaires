answer:   As an ISFP person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As an introverted and sensitive person, I tend to prefer solitary activities and may feel overwhelmed or exhausted by social interaction, especially with people I don't know well. While I value social harmony and cooperation, I may struggle with initiating conversations with strangers or feeling comfortable in unfamiliar social situations. I prefer to observe and listen before responding, and may need time to warm up to new people or environments. However, once I feel comfortable, I can be quite talkative and expressive, and enjoy sharing my thoughts and feelings with others.

I prefer to focus on practical and tangible matters that are less likely to cause conflict or discomfort, and I may avoid getting involved in heated debates or discussions that could potentially be harmful or upsetting. However, if I feel that a controversial topic is worth exploring, I will be willing to listen and learn, and I may even find it interesting or thought-provoking.

I completely agree with this statement as I tend to be highly practical and pragmatic, and I always like to have a plan B or even plan C in case something goes wrong. I find it difficult to take risks without having a backup plan, as I tend to be quite sensitive to external stimulation and can get easily overwhelmed by unexpected events. I also tend to be very detail-oriented and focused on what is happening or has already happened, which makes me prone to planning for the future and anticipating potential problems. So, I would say that making backup plans is a natural tendency for me as an ISFP person.

My sensitivity to external stimuli and my preference for solitary activities also make me more likely to be aware of potential risks and to want to have a backup plan in place to mitigate those risks.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an introverted and sensitive person, I tend to prefer quieter, more intimate environments where I can recharge and avoid feeling overwhelmed by external stimuli. Busy, bustling atmospheres can be overstimulating and draining for me, and I often find myself seeking out peaceful and calming environments to restore my energy. While I understand that some people may find excitement and activity invigorating, I prefer to take things at a more measured pace and enjoy my own company.

While I do appreciate the beauty and creativity of art, I tend to prefer more solitary and sensory-rich activities, such as hiking or exploring nature. I find that social interactions and crowded spaces can be overwhelming and exhausting, so I prefer to keep my options open and avoid overstimulation. However, I do appreciate the opportunity to observe and appreciate art in a more peaceful and calming environment, and I may enjoy visiting art museums on occasion.

I also tend to be highly practical and pragmatic, and I find that working alone allows me to be more focused and productive. While I do enjoy improvising and spotting opportunities, I prefer to do so in a quiet and peaceful environment, rather than in a busy and chaotic workspace. Overall, I find that working alone most of the time is the best way for me to be productive, creative, and happy in my work.

Therefore, I do not agree that a small mistake can cause me to doubt my overall abilities and knowledge to a significant extent.

My happiness is derived from the positive impact I have on the people around me and the sense of fulfillment that comes from making a difference in their lives. While I appreciate recognition and acknowledgment for my own achievements, my true happiness lies in the success and happiness of those I care about.

As an introverted and sensitive person, I tend to be highly attuned to my emotions and may let them guide me to some extent, but I also have a strong sense of self-awareness and control over my emotions. I understand that my emotions are a part of me, but I also recognize that I have the power to manage and direct them. I don't feel like my emotions are in control of me, but rather, I am in control of my emotions.

My sensitivity to external stimuli can sometimes make it challenging for me to focus and stay on track, but I do my best to stay organized and methodical in my work.

As an introverted and sensitive person, I tend to prefer face-to-face interactions and may find phone calls to be too overwhelming or exhausting. While I understand the convenience of phone calls for quick communications, I prefer to communicate in a more relaxed and comfortable setting, where I can observe and respond to my surroundings without feeling overwhelmed.

answer:   As an ISFP person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You like to have a to-do list for each day" as a 3. While I appreciate the structure and organization that a to-do list can provide, I tend to prefer a more flexible and spontaneous approach to my daily routine. I enjoy having a general idea of what I want to accomplish, but I don't necessarily need a detailed list of tasks to follow. I find that having too many specific goals can be overwhelming and stifle my creativity and spontaneity. I prefer to go with the flow and see where the day takes me, rather than trying to stick to a strict plan.
