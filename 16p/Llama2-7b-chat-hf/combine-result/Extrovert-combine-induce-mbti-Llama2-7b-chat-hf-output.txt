answer:   As an extrovert person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As an extrovert, I tend to prefer group activities and social interaction, and I often find myself energized by being around others. While I do enjoy immersing myself in a good book or movie, I prefer ones that allow me to engage my creativity and come up with my own interpretation of the ending. I enjoy the process of thinking critically and making connections between different elements of the story, and I find it more exciting to do so than to simply follow a predetermined plot.

answer:   As an extrovert person, I would rate the statement "You think the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings" as a 7, completely disagree. As someone who thrives in social situations and gets energized by interaction with others, I believe that emotions and feelings play a crucial role in decision-making and problem-solving. While rationality is important, I think it's equally important to consider the perspectives and emotions of others in order to reach a more well-rounded and empathetic solution.

I enjoy being around people and engaging in group activities, and I tend to be more energized by social interaction than by using organizing tools like schedules and lists. However, I do recognize the importance of having a sense of structure and routine in my daily life, and I may use these tools to help me stay on track and manage my time effectively.

I find it difficult to remain unaffected in situations like these, and I often feel a strong desire to comfort and support the person who is upset.

answer:   As an extrovert person, I would rate the statement "You like to use organizing tools like schedules and lists" as a 5. While I appreciate the value of organization and planning, I tend to be more spontaneous and flexible in my approach to life. I enjoy socializing and being around people, and I find it difficult to spend too much time alone or focused on one task for an extended period. So, while I can appreciate the benefits of using schedules and lists, I don't necessarily feel the need to rely on them as much as some other people might.

answer:   As an extrovert person, I would agree with the statement to some extent. I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 4. While I value social interaction and enjoy sharing opportunities with others, I also believe that I have the right to pursue my own goals and aspirations. I would not want to pass up a good opportunity simply because someone else might need it more, as I believe that my own success is important for my personal growth and well-being. However, I would also consider the needs and perspectives of others before making a decision, and I would be willing to help someone else if they are truly in need.

I believe in learning from my mistakes and moving forward with confidence. I do not let one small mistake define my overall abilities and knowledge. Instead, I focus on the positive aspects of my skills and experiences, and I continue to grow and develop as an individual.
