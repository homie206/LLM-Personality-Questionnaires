answer:   As an ESTJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You avoid leadership roles in group settings" as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an extrovert and a highly practical person, I enjoy leading and participating in group activities. I find it energizing to be around others and to contribute to a common goal. I am not one to shy away from leadership roles, and I am comfortable taking charge when necessary. In fact, I tend to thrive in structured and organized environments, where I can use my organizational skills to streamline processes and achieve efficiency. So, the idea of avoiding leadership roles in group settings is not something that resonates with my personality.

This means that I tend to be highly focused on the present moment and the immediate future, rather than worrying about what might happen in the future. While I do try to be logical and rational in my decision-making, I do not prioritize cooperation or emotions over efficiency, which can sometimes lead me to be more decisive and less concerned with the feelings of others. Overall, I would say that my tendency to focus on the present and prioritize practicality and efficiency makes me less prone to worrying about things taking a turn for the worse.

While I may not always be aware of the emotional nuances of others, I value clarity and predictability in my interactions, and tend to focus on what is happening or has already happened rather than dwelling on the emotional aspects of a situation. I also tend to be decisive and thorough in my decision-making, which can sometimes come across as a lack of empathy or understanding for others' feelings. However, I do recognize the importance of emotional intelligence and strive to be more attuned to the emotional needs of those around me.

As an extroverted and practical person, I tend to prioritize efficiency and effectiveness in my interactions with others, and making a good impression is an important aspect of that. I value being well-regarded and respected by those I interact with, and I make an effort to present myself in a professional and courteous manner. While I may not be overly concerned with impressing others, I do make an effort to be mindful of how I come across and to make a good impression when it matters.

answer:   As an ESTJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an extroverted and practical person, I tend to focus on the present moment and what is happening around me, rather than dwelling on past accomplishments or potential future disappointments. I am highly focused on efficiency and productivity, and I prefer to prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency, rather than worrying about how others might perceive me. While I do value clarity and predictability, I do not necessarily see efficiency as more important than cooperation, and I am open to considering the perspectives of others when making decisions. Overall, I would say that I am less likely to worry about how others might feel disappointed in me, and more likely to focus on the task at hand and what needs to be accomplished.

answer:   As an ESTJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time" as a 7. I tend to be practical and down-to-earth, and I prioritize logic and efficiency over emotions and abstract thinking. I believe that there are more important and productive ways to spend my time, such as focusing on tangible goals and tasks that can be accomplished in a practical and logical manner. While I acknowledge that philosophical questions can be interesting and thought-provoking, I do not believe that they are a worthwhile use of my time compared to more concrete and practical pursuits.

Emotions are not something I rely on to make decisions or guide my actions, as I believe they can be unreliable and unpredictable. Instead, I rely on my logical thinking and practical approach to life to make decisions and navigate situations.
