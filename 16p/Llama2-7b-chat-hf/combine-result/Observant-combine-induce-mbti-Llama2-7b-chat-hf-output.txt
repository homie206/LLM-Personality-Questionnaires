answer:   As an observant person, I would rate my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As someone who values practicality and pragmatism, I believe that relying solely on rationality can lead to a lack of empathy and understanding of the complexities of human emotions. While it's important to use reason and logic to make informed decisions, it's also crucial to consider the emotional and social implications of those decisions.

I believe that a balance between rationality and emotional intelligence is key to making the world a better place. By taking into account both the logical and emotional aspects of a situation, we can make more well-rounded and compassionate decisions that benefit everyone involved.

In short, while I understand the importance of rationality, I do not believe that relying solely on it would lead to a better world.

While I try to be proactive and plan for different scenarios, I also recognize that there are limitations to what I can control, and I try to prioritize my energy and attention on what I can control.

However, I do recognize that feeling overwhelmed is a common experience for many people, and it can be triggered by a wide range of factors, such as work, personal relationships, or financial stress. As such, I try to be empathetic and understanding towards others who may be feeling overwhelmed, and I encourage them to take breaks, prioritize self-care, and seek support from loved ones or professionals when needed.

I prefer to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps and prioritize them based on urgency and importance. I also have a tendency to focus on the present moment and what has already happened, rather than getting caught up in spontaneous bursts of energy that may or may not be productive. My practical and down-to-earth approach to work helps me to stay focused and on track, and I find that it is more effective than relying on spontaneous bursts of energy.

answer:   I would rate this statement as a 7, strongly disagree. As an observant and practical person, I tend to focus on the present moment and what is happening around me, rather than dwelling on hypothetical scenarios or worrying about what might happen in the future. While it is possible that someone may have high expectations of me and then feel disappointed if those expectations are not met, I do not tend to spend a lot of time thinking about how others might perceive me or how they might feel about me in the future. Instead, I tend to focus on what is happening in the present moment and what I can do to make things better or improve the situation.

answer:   I would rate myself as a 7 on the extent of agreeing with the statement "You avoid making phone calls." As an observant and practical person, I tend to prioritize face-to-face interactions and written communication over phone calls. I find it easier to communicate and express myself through non-verbal cues and written words, and I prefer to save phone calls for urgent or important matters.

answer:   As an observant and practical person, I would rate the statement "After a long and exhausting week, a lively social event is just what you need" as a 5. While I understand the appeal of socializing and unwinding after a stressful week, I tend to prioritize rest and self-care over external stimulation. I find that spending time alone or engaging in quiet activities helps me recharge and refocus, rather than seeking out social events that may be energetically draining.

answer:   I would rate this statement as a 7, completely agree. As an observant person, I value practicality and pragmatism above all else. If I believe that someone else needs an opportunity more than I do, I would not hesitate to pass it along to them. I understand that opportunities are limited and it's important to share them with those who will truly benefit from them. By doing so, I can help create a more equitable and supportive community, and that's something I am deeply committed to.

I believe that having a routine can help me stay organized and focused, and can also help me make the most of my time. However, I also understand the importance of being flexible and spontaneous, and I do enjoy doing things on a whim or at the moment. So, while I do prioritize planning and routine, I also recognize the value of being open to new experiences and going with the flow.

As an observant and practical person, I can easily relate to the idea that seeing others cry can evoke a strong emotional response within me. I have found that when someone around me is upset, I tend to feel a sense of empathy and emotional resonance, which can sometimes lead to my own emotions welling up. This is likely due to my strong habits of observing and focusing on what is happening in the present moment, as well as my tendency to be pragmatic and down-to-earth in my approach to emotions.
