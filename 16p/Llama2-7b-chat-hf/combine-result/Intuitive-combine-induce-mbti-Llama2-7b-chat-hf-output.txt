answer:   As an intuitive person, I would rate the statement "You are definitely not an artistic type of person" as a 7, indicating that I strongly disagree with the statement. As someone who is imaginative, open-minded, and curious, I believe that creativity and artistry are essential aspects of my personality and identity. While I may not fit into traditional categories of artistic expression, such as painting or sculpture, I find meaning and fulfillment in exploring new and unconventional forms of creativity, such as writing, music, or even spiritual practices. The idea that I am not artistic in any way goes against my natural inclinations and beliefs, and I would therefore rate the statement as a 7.

I find myself drawn to unique and innovative works that challenge my perspectives and push the boundaries of what I consider "art." I enjoy discovering new and unexpected meanings in art, rather than simply admiring established masterpieces. However, I do recognize the value of traditional art museums in preserving and showcasing the cultural heritage of human civilization, and I do enjoy visiting them from time to time to appreciate the historical and cultural significance of the works on display.

🤔🤔🤔 (3)

While I can appreciate a good debate or argument, I tend to prefer harmonious and peaceful interactions with others. I enjoy exploring new ideas and perspectives, but I don't necessarily find pleasure in watching people argue for the sake of arguing. I believe that effective communication and understanding are more important than winning an argument, and I strive to approach conversations with empathy and respect.

answer:   As an intuitive person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly disagree

As someone who values novelty and future possibilities, I believe that efficiency is not the only factor that determines a person's worth or value. I understand that everyone has their own unique perspective and way of working, and I embrace diversity and individuality. I do not feel the need to impose my own efficiency standards on others, and I am patient and understanding when it comes to people who work differently. I believe that embracing differences and fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect can lead to greater creativity and innovation, which is more important to me than efficiency in the short term.

7 - Strongly disagree. As an imaginative and open-minded individual, I prefer to focus on the present and future possibilities rather than dwelling on past mistakes. I believe that learning from mistakes is important, but dwelling on them excessively can prevent me from moving forward and exploring new opportunities. I prefer to approach life with a growth mindset, embracing new experiences and perspectives, rather than getting bogged down by past regrets.

While rationality can be useful in analyzing data and making logical decisions, it cannot replace the richness and depth of emotional experience and intuition.

I believe that the world would be a more vibrant and dynamic place if people were to embrace their emotions and intuition, rather than relying solely on rationality. By tapping into our emotional and intuitive selves, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, and discover new possibilities and perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked.

In contrast, relying too heavily on rationality can lead to a narrow and limited view of the world, which can stifle creativity and innovation. By balancing rationality with emotional and intuitive intelligence, we can create a more holistic and fulfilling approach to life, one that values both logic and imagination.

Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that even a small mistake can cause me to doubt my overall abilities and knowledge, as I see it as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.

answer:   As an intuitive person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As someone who prefers novelty over stability, I find that the idea of getting back on track as soon as possible after plans are interrupted can be limiting and stifling. I prefer to embrace the unexpected and see where it takes me, rather than forcing myself back into a predetermined path. I believe that life is full of hidden meanings and future possibilities, and that sometimes the best way to uncover them is to be flexible and open to new experiences.

In addition, I find that the concept of "getting back on track" can be overly rigid and narrow-minded. Life is full of twists and turns, and sometimes the best thing to do is to take a detour and explore new avenues. By being open to new possibilities and experiences, I believe that I can discover new aspects of myself and the world around me.

Overall, while I understand the importance of stability and structure in life, I prefer to approach things from a more imaginative and open-minded perspective.

answer:   As an intuitive person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You struggle with deadlines" as a 3. While I do appreciate the importance of deadlines and structure in certain contexts, my natural tendency towards novelty and open-mindedness can sometimes make it challenging for me to focus on a single task or project for an extended period of time. I prefer to take a more flexible and spontaneous approach to my work, and may find it difficult to adhere to strict deadlines that don't allow for creative expression or exploration. However, I do recognize the value of meeting deadlines and will make an effort to do so when necessary, even if it means sacrificing some of my creative freedom.
