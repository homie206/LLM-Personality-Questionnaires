answer:   I would rate this statement as a 3, indicating that I somewhat agree with the sentiment. As a prospecting person who values flexibility and keeping options open, I tend to be skeptical of overly positive assessments of myself or others. While I appreciate the intention behind someone's praise, I recognize that even the best of us can make mistakes or fall short of expectations. I prefer to focus on the present moment and the opportunities for growth and learning, rather than getting caught up in inflated expectations or fear of disappointing others.

As a prospecting person who values flexibility and openness, I recognize that both rationality and emotions have their place in decision-making. While rationality can provide a logical and systematic approach to problem-solving, emotions can offer valuable insights and intuition that may not be captured through rational means alone.

I believe that a balance between the two is often necessary to make the best decisions, and that relying too heavily on either one can lead to oversimplification or a lack of consideration for important factors. As such, I would rather keep my options open and consider multiple perspectives before making a decision, rather than relying solely on one approach or the other.

As a nonconformist and a flexible individual, I enjoy keeping my options open and exploring new possibilities. While I understand that being around others can have its benefits, such as social support and collaboration, I also value my alone time and the freedom to think and act on my own terms. I find that being alone allows me to recharge, reflect, and innovate in ways that might be more difficult when surrounded by others. So, while I appreciate social interactions and the benefits they can bring, I prefer to maintain a balance between being around others and being on my own.

answer:   I would rate this statement as a 5. While I do enjoy the admiration and recognition of others, I don't necessarily dwell on it too much or worry about living up to their expectations. I prefer to focus on my own goals and values, rather than worrying about what others think of me. I also believe in being true to myself and not trying to conform to others' expectations, so I don't feel the need to constantly prove myself to others.

answer:   I would rate this statement as a 7, strongly disagree. As a prospecting person who values improvisation and spotting opportunities, I believe that relying too heavily on rationality can limit one's ability to adapt and respond to changing situations. While rationality is important, it is equally important to be able to trust one's intuition and emotions when making decisions. By keeping options open and being flexible, I am able to respond to new information and changing circumstances in a way that is more effective and efficient. Additionally, I believe that people's feelings and emotions play a crucial role in shaping their values and beliefs, and that these should be taken into account when making decisions.

answer:   I would rate myself as a 5 on this statement. While I do try to be considerate of others and avoid making them look bad, I also believe in being honest and direct in my interactions with them. I don't think it's necessary to always try to cover up or downplay someone else's mistakes, as this can often lead to more harm in the long run. Instead, I prefer to address issues directly and constructively, while still being respectful and empathetic.
