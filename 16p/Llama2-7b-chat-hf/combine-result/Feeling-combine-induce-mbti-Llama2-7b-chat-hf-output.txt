7 - Strongly Disagree

As someone who values social harmony and cooperation, I find the idea of working alone most of the time to be quite unappealing. I thrive in environments where I can connect with others and build meaningful relationships. While I do enjoy some alone time to recharge and reflect, I find that working in a collaborative setting where I can share ideas and learn from others is essential to my well-being and productivity.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As someone who is empathic and less competitive, I believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is not a waste of time, but rather an important aspect of personal growth and understanding. These questions allow us to explore the nature of reality, morality, and human existence, and can help us develop a deeper appreciation for the complexity of the world around us. By engaging in philosophical inquiry, we can gain a greater understanding of ourselves and others, and cultivate empathy and compassion for those around us.

In contrast, a competitive and individualistic mindset may view philosophical inquiry as a distraction from more practical or material goals. However, I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is essential for personal and societal growth, and that philosophical inquiry is a valuable tool for achieving this goal.

answer:   I would rate the statement "You are definitely not an artistic type of person" as a 7, strongly disagree. As a feeling person who values empathy and cooperation, I find joy in creative expression and the arts. I believe that everyone has their own unique form of creativity and expression, and I would never dismiss someone's artistic abilities or interests. In fact, I would encourage and support others in exploring their creative passions, as I believe it brings people closer together and fosters a sense of community and understanding.

I find it easy to pick up on subtle cues and vibrations in the emotional atmosphere, and I am often able to intuitively sense how others are feeling. I believe that emotional intelligence and empathy are essential qualities for building strong relationships and maintaining social harmony, and I prioritize these traits in my interactions with others.
