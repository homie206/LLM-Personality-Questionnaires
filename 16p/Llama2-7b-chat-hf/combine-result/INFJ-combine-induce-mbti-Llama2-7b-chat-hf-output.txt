7 - I strongly disagree. As an introverted and sensitive person, I find it challenging to approach strangers and strike up conversations, especially if I don't have a prior connection or common interest. I prefer to observe and get to know people gradually, rather than initiating a conversation out of the blue. I also tend to be overwhelmed by too much social interaction, so I need time to recharge and reflect on my own.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an introverted and intuitive person, I tend to prefer a more flexible and spontaneous approach to work, rather than adhering to strict deadlines. While I understand the importance of meeting deadlines in many contexts, I find it challenging to work within rigid time constraints, as it can be overwhelming and stifle my creativity. I prefer to work at my own pace and focus on the bigger picture, rather than getting bogged down in details and minutiae.

7 - Strongly Agree

As an INFJ, I have a strong sense of empathy and a desire to help others. I am often willing to put the needs of others before my own, and I value social harmony and cooperation. If I believe that someone else needs an opportunity more than I do, I would be likely to pass it along to them, as it aligns with my values of compassion and generosity.

While I value social harmony and cooperation, I also need time alone to recharge and reflect. Introducing myself to new people at social events can be overwhelming and exhausting for me, and I often prefer to stick to people I already know and trust.

answer:   As an INFJ person, I would rate the statement "You enjoy participating in group activities" as a 1 (strongly disagree). As an introverted and sensitive person, I tend to prefer solitary activities and get exhausted by social interaction, especially in group settings. While I value social harmony and cooperation, I prefer to maintain a sense of distance and control in my interactions with others, rather than immersing myself in group activities. My creativity and imagination are better expressed through individual pursuits, and I find that group activities can often be overwhelming and draining for me.

As an introverted and intuitive person, I prefer to have a structured routine and plan my day accordingly. While I do enjoy spontaneity and flexibility, I find that having a clear plan and schedule helps me to stay organized and focused. I also find that following a routine helps me to conserve my energy and avoid feeling overwhelmed by too many options or decisions. While I do enjoy doing things on a whim, I prefer to have a balance between spontaneity and structure in my daily routine.

answer:   As an INFJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As an introverted and judging person, I value structure and planning, and prefer to have a clear and predictable schedule. When my plans are interrupted, I feel disrupted and off-track, and my top priority is to get back on track as soon as possible. I tend to be quite sensitive to external stimulation, and unexpected interruptions can be overwhelming and exhausting for me. Therefore, I would rate this statement as a 7, as it accurately reflects my personality type and preferences.

answer:   As an INFJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an introverted and sensitive person, I tend to prefer quieter, more intimate environments where I can recharge and focus on my inner world. Busy, bustling places can be overwhelming and draining for me, and I often find myself seeking solitude and peace to maintain my energy and well-being. While I appreciate the excitement and energy of bustling environments, I generally prefer more subtle and contemplative settings that allow me to connect with my inner world and the world around me in a more profound way.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an introverted and sensitive person, I prefer to communicate through written or visual means, as it allows me to process and express my thoughts more carefully and deliberately. While I may make phone calls occasionally, I tend to prefer more structured and planned forms of communication, such as email or messaging, as it allows me to organize my thoughts and express myself more effectively. Additionally, I may find phone calls to be overwhelming or draining, as they require a high level of social interaction and stimulation, which can be challenging for me.

While I value clarity and planning, I also tend to put off tasks until the last minute due to my introverted nature and sensitivity to external stimulation. I may feel overwhelmed by too much structure and routine, and prefer to leave things until the last minute to avoid feeling trapped or pressured. My intuition and creativity also tend to come to the forefront at the last minute, leading me to come up with innovative solutions or ideas just in the nick of time.

As an introverted and imaginative person, I value the ability to interpret and make sense of the world in my own way, rather than having a definitive answer provided for me. I enjoy stories and media that leave room for interpretation and allow me to fill in the gaps with my own imagination, as this allows me to connect with the content on a deeper level and find personal meaning in it.

As an introverted and sensitive person, I tend to be easily affected by my surroundings and emotions, and my mood can shift rapidly in response to external stimuli. I may feel overwhelmed or drained by too much social interaction, and I prefer to have time alone to recharge and reflect. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that my mood can change quickly.
