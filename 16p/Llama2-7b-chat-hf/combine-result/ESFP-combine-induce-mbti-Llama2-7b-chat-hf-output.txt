answer:   As an ESFP person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You avoid making phone calls" as a 5. While I enjoy social interaction and group activities, I do not necessarily enjoy making phone calls as it can be a more impersonal and structured form of communication. I prefer to communicate in person or through more spontaneous and flexible means, such as texting or messaging. However, I understand the importance of phone calls in certain situations and am not completely opposed to them.

answer:   As an ESFP person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an extroverted, feeling, and practical person, I tend to be highly energized by social interaction and group activities. I prefer to focus on the present moment and enjoy improvising and spotting opportunities. I am also highly empathic and sensitive to the emotions of others, which makes me less competitive and more focused on social harmony and cooperation.

Therefore, I tend to be patient and understanding towards people who may not be as efficient as me, as I recognize that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. I believe in working together and finding ways to complement each other's skills and abilities, rather than comparing ourselves to others and losing patience when things don't go as planned.

answer:   As an ESFP person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You enjoy going to art museums" as a 5. While I do enjoy socializing and interacting with others, I tend to prefer more hands-on and practical activities rather than cultural events like art museums. I appreciate the beauty and creativity of art, but I may not necessarily seek out art museums as a primary source of entertainment or inspiration. I prefer to engage with art in a more direct and interactive way, such as through creative hobbies or spontaneous improvisation.

While I do enjoy social interaction and group activities, I tend to be more comfortable blending in and observing rather than seeking the spotlight. I prefer to let others take center stage and avoid drawing attention to myself, as I find it easier to connect with people in a more low-key manner. However, I do enjoy being the life of the party and making others laugh, so I'm not completely averse to drawing attention to myself when the mood strikes me.

answer:   As an ESFP person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As an extroverted and practical person, I tend to prioritize getting back on track as soon as possible when my plans are interrupted. I value efficiency and productivity, and I find it frustrating when things don't go according to plan. I prefer to adapt and find new ways to achieve my goals, rather than getting bogged down in setbacks or procrastination. My focus is on finding solutions and moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past or getting stuck in a rut.

As an extroverted, practical, and pragmatic person, I tend to be very detail-oriented and enjoy completing tasks in a systematic and organized manner. I prefer to follow a step-by-step approach to ensure that everything is done correctly and efficiently. I also tend to be very focused and disciplined when working on a task, and I don't like to skip over any steps or take shortcuts, as I believe that this can lead to mistakes or subpar results. Overall, I would say that completing things methodically is a key aspect of my personality and approach to work and life.

answer:   As an ESFP person, I would rate the statement "After a long and exhausting week, a lively social event is just what I need" as a 7, completely agree. As an extroverted and feeling person, I tend to recharge my energy through social interaction and group activities. A long and exhausting week can leave me feeling drained and in need of a boost, and a lively social event is just the thing to get me out of my shell and back into a more energetic state. I thrive in social situations and find them energizing, so the idea of attending a social event after a tiring week is something that I would highly agree with.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an extroverted and optimistic person, I tend to be more focused on the present and future, rather than dwelling on past experiences or potential disappointments. I believe in the power of positive thinking and the importance of maintaining a positive attitude, especially in my relationships with others. While I understand that disappointment can be a natural part of life, I don't tend to dwell on it or worry about it excessively. Instead, I try to focus on the good things in life and the opportunities that lie ahead.

As an extroverted and practical person, I tend to be highly focused on the present moment and what is happening around me. While I can be highly organized and efficient in my own way, I may struggle with the concept of deadlines and the need to plan and prioritize tasks in advance. I tend to be more spontaneous and adaptable, and may prefer to take things as they come rather than worrying about meeting artificial deadlines. However, I do appreciate the importance of meeting deadlines and will do my best to meet them once I have committed to doing so.

7 - Strongly Agree

As an extroverted, feeling, and prospecting person, I tend to derive my happiness and energy from social interaction and helping others. I find joy in seeing others succeed and accomplish their goals, and I feel a strong sense of fulfillment when I can contribute to their success. While I do enjoy personal achievements and accomplishments, my true happiness comes from being able to make a positive impact on the lives of those around me.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an extroverted and practical person, I tend to focus on the present moment and what is happening around me. While I appreciate philosophical discussions and exploring abstract ideas, I tend to prioritize practical and tangible matters. Contemplating the meaning of life or human existence is not something I often engage in, as I prefer to focus on the here and now and enjoy the simple pleasures in life.
