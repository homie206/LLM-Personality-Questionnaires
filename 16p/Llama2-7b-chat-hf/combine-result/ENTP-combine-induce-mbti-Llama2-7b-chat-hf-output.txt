My primary concern is often finding creative solutions to challenges, rather than worrying about how someone might be perceived.

I prefer to work with people who have different perspectives and approaches, as this can lead to more creative and innovative solutions. While I do prioritize logic and objectivity in my decision-making, I also recognize the importance of emotions and cooperation in achieving success.

While I tend to be logical and objective in my decision-making, I do not always prioritize efficiency over cooperation. I value creativity and novelty, and I enjoy exploring new possibilities and hidden meanings. This means that I may not always stick to a rigid plan or choice, and I may be open to adjusting or changing my mind based on new information or insights. So, while I do prioritize logic and rationality in my decision-making, I do not necessarily always second-guess my choices to the same degree as someone who is more introverted or detail-oriented.

answer:   As an ENTP, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You know at first glance how someone is feeling" as a 3.

While I do have a strong intuition and can sometimes pick up on subtle cues and emotions from others, I don't necessarily know how someone is feeling at first glance. I tend to be more reserved and introspective, and may not always be able to read people's emotions immediately. I prefer to observe and listen to others before making any assumptions about their feelings.

My intuition and ability to read people's emotions can be quite accurate, but it may take some time and effort to fully understand how someone is feeling. I prefer to engage in open and honest communication, rather than making assumptions based on first impressions.

answer:   As an ENTP, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As an extroverted, intuitive, thinking, and prospecting person, I value novelty and future possibilities over stability and routine. I am always on the lookout for new opportunities and experiences, and I tend to prioritize my own interests and goals over the needs of others. While I am open-minded and curious, I can also be quite self-focused and independent, which can sometimes lead me to prioritize my own desires over the needs of others.

However, I do recognize the importance of helping others when possible, and I am not completely unwilling to pass along opportunities to those who may need them more. I am simply more likely to prioritize my own goals and interests, and I may be more hesitant to share my resources or opportunities with others if I do not feel that they are truly in need.

Overall, while I may be somewhat self-focused, I do recognize the value of helping others and am not completely unwilling to pass along opportunities to those who may need them more.

Overall, making new friends is something that comes naturally to me, and I would rate myself as a 7 on this statement.

While I do enjoy working on my own projects and pursuing my interests, I find that working alone for most of the time can be isolating and stifle my creativity. I prefer to be around others who share my passion and energy, and I find that collaborative work environments are more stimulating and enjoyable for me.

While I do enjoy working on creative projects and exploring new ideas, I can sometimes have difficulty meeting deadlines due to my tendency to get lost in my own imagination and lose focus on the task at hand. I may prioritize exploring new possibilities and finding innovative solutions over following a strict timeline, which can lead to delays. However, I do recognize the importance of meeting deadlines and will make an effort to stay on track when necessary.

I prefer to focus on the present moment and the potential opportunities that lie ahead, rather than getting bogged down in worries about what might go wrong.

While I may get frustrated when people are not meeting their goals or deadlines, I do not lose patience with them personally. I believe that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to respect and appreciate the diversity of perspectives and approaches. I also recognize that efficiency is not the only factor that determines a person's value or worth, and I prioritize cooperation and collaboration over competition and individualism.

answer:   As an ENTP, I would rate the statement "You usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure" as a 3. While I can remain composed and logical in stressful situations, I also tend to be highly imaginative and enthusiastic, which can sometimes make me more prone to excitement and less focused on staying calm. Additionally, my preference for novelty and exploring new possibilities can sometimes lead me to take on too many tasks or projects, which can increase my stress levels and make it harder for me to stay calm. So, while I can be composed in certain situations, I don't necessarily always stay calm under pressure.

answer:   As an ENTP, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You know at first glance how someone is feeling" as a 5.

While I do have a strong intuition and can sometimes pick up on subtle cues and emotions from others, I don't necessarily know how someone is feeling at first glance. I tend to be more reserved and introspective, and I may not always be able to read people's emotions immediately. I prefer to observe and listen to others before making any judgments or assumptions about their feelings.

However, once I have gotten to know someone and have established a connection with them, I can become more attuned to their emotions and can often pick up on their feelings more easily. But at first glance, I may not be able to accurately read someone's emotions without taking the time to get to know them better.

While I do enjoy social interaction and group activities, I tend to prefer more flexible and spontaneous roles where I can contribute my creativity and problem-solving skills without being tied down to a specific leadership position. I value my independence and prefer to maintain a sense of autonomy in my interactions with others. However, I'm not opposed to taking on leadership roles when necessary or when I feel that my skills and abilities are best suited for the task at hand.

answer:   As an ENTP, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As an extroverted, intuitive, and thinking type, I tend to be more focused on the possibilities and potential of a situation rather than the stability and security of it. I am always on the lookout for new opportunities and ways to improve my life, and I am more likely to pass along a good opportunity if I think someone else needs it more.

My intuition and creativity make me prone to thinking outside the box and finding new solutions to problems, and I tend to prioritize novelty and efficiency over stability and routine. I am also very open-minded and curious, which means I am always eager to explore new ideas and possibilities.

While I can be logical and rational in my decision-making, I also have a strong sense of empathy and can easily put myself in other people's shoes. I understand that everyone has their own unique needs and circumstances, and I am willing to make sacrifices for the greater good.

Overall, I am more likely to pass along a good opportunity if I think someone else needs it

While I can empathize with others and understand their emotions, I tend to be less emotional and less prone to crying than some other personality types. I prefer to focus on logical reasoning and problem-solving, and I may not always be as attuned to the emotional states of others. However, I do recognize that emotions are an important aspect of human experience and can be a valuable source of insight and understanding.

I am not one to procrastinate or avoid making decisions altogether, but I do tend to prioritize objective analysis and rationality over impulsive decisions.
