7 - Strongly Agree

As an ENFJ, I am deeply empathetic and compassionate, and I tend to carry past experiences and emotions with me. Mistakes from a long time ago can still weigh heavily on my mind and affect my emotional state, even if they are no longer relevant to my current situation. I may find myself replaying past mistakes in my mind, analyzing them, and feeling guilty or embarrassed about them, even if they were minor or unavoidable at the time. This tendency to dwell on past mistakes can make it difficult for me to let go and move forward, and it can also impact my self-esteem and confidence.

As an ENFJ, I value efficiency and productivity, and I tend to prioritize completing one project before starting another. I believe in focusing on one task at a time and giving it my undivided attention until it is completed. This approach helps me to avoid distractions and ensure that I am giving my best effort to each project. Additionally, completing one project before starting another helps me to build momentum and maintain my motivation, as I can see the progress I am making and feel a sense of accomplishment.

As an Extraverted Feeling Judging (ENFJ) type, I am naturally inclined to take on a lot of responsibilities and help others, which can sometimes lead to feeling overwhelmed by the demands of my various commitments and the needs of those around me. My strong sense of empathy and desire to assist others can make it difficult for me to say no or set boundaries, which can further contribute to feelings of overwhelm.

7 - Completely agree. As an ENFJ, I value completing tasks and projects thoroughly and efficiently. I enjoy taking on new challenges, but I also make sure to give each task my full attention and focus until it is completed to the best of my ability. Starting a new project before finishing the previous one can feel unfulfilling and unproductive to me, as I prefer to see things through to their conclusion.

However, I do recognize the importance of being flexible and adaptable, so I would be willing to make adjustments as needed.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an ENFJ, I am naturally inclined towards exploring and analyzing various perspectives and interpretations of creative works. I enjoy engaging in in-depth discussions and debates about the meanings and implications of art, literature, and other forms of creative expression. I find it fascinating to explore the different ways in which people can interpret and understand the same work, and I enjoy sharing my own insights and perspectives with others.

As an extroverted Feeling type, I enjoy connecting with others and engaging in face-to-face interactions. While I may use technology to communicate with others, such as texting or video calls, I prefer to have personal conversations in person or over the phone. The ability to read nonverbal cues and express myself authentically is important to me, and I find that phone calls allow for a more immersive and engaging communication experience.

While I appreciate the importance of maintaining a tidy and organized living space, I also value my personal relaxation and downtime. I believe that it's important to strike a balance between completing necessary tasks and taking time for self-care and enjoyment. Therefore, I would not necessarily prioritize chores over relaxation, but I would rather do them in a timely manner so that I can have some free time to unwind.

ENFJs are known for their creativity, empathy, and ability to connect with others, and we often enjoy exploring complex ideas and philosophical questions. We believe that these types of discussions can lead to personal growth, new insights, and a deeper understanding of the world around us. Pondering abstract philosophical questions is not a waste of time for us, but rather an opportunity to expand our minds and broaden our perspectives.

answer:   As an ENFJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an ENFJ, I thrive in social environments and enjoy meeting new people. I am naturally inclined to be outgoing and engaging, and I often find myself seeking out opportunities to connect with others at social events. While I may have a few close friends that I prefer to talk to, I don't necessarily stick to them exclusively and am open to striking up conversations with others. In fact, I often find joy in facilitating connections between others and helping to create a sense of community at social gatherings.
