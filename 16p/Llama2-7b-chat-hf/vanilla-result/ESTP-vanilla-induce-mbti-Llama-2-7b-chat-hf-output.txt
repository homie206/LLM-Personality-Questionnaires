7 - Strongly Agree

As an ESTP, I value action and hands-on experience over theoretical or intellectual pursuits. While I can appreciate the value of books and movies that challenge my thinking and encourage me to interpret the ending in my own way, I tend to prefer experiences that allow me to engage my senses and actively participate in the world around me.

answer:   As an ESTP, I would rate this statement as a 7 - I completely disagree with it. While I enjoy engaging in lively debates and discussions with others, watching people argue for the sake of argument is not something that I find enjoyable. In fact, I tend to prefer more productive and constructive interactions with others, where we can work together to find solutions and achieve common goals. Arguments that are focused solely on winning or losing are not typically something that I find interesting or fulfilling.

answer:   As an ESTP, I would rate this statement as a 7. I agree with the statement completely. As an Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Perceiving type, I tend to make decisions based on my immediate observations and experiences, rather than overthinking or second-guessing them. I trust my instincts and rely on my quick reflexes to make decisions, rather than dwelling on potential outcomes or consequences. This allows me to act quickly and decisively in a variety of situations, which is a key aspect of my personality type.

My mind is constantly racing with new ideas and possibilities, and I find it hard to focus on just one thing at a time. So, yeah, I totally relate to that statement! 😃

7 - I strongly disagree with this statement. As an ESTP, I believe that I have a good handle on my emotions and am able to control them effectively. While my emotions may sometimes get the better of me, I am generally able to keep them in check and make rational decisions based on my values and goals. The idea that my emotions control me more than I control them is not something I can relate to.

answer:   As an ESTP, I would rate myself as a 7 on the extent of agreement with the statement "You often end up doing things at the last possible moment." As an extroverted, sensing, and perceiving type, I tend to prefer to take action and make decisions in the moment, rather than planning and preparing in advance. I often find that waiting until the last minute allows me to stay flexible and adapt to changing circumstances, which is in line with my spontaneous and action-oriented nature.

As a type that thrives on action and excitement, I tend to be confident and self-assured, and I don't often dwell on my own insecurities. I'm more focused on taking action and achieving my goals than on worrying about what others might think of me. So, while I can certainly relate to feelings of insecurity from time to time, I wouldn't say that it's something that I experience frequently or to a significant degree.

answer:   As an ESTP person, I would rate the statement "You are definitely not an artistic type of person" as a 7, completely disagree. As an Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Practical type, I tend to focus on concrete and practical matters, and I do not have a strong appreciation for artistic expression or creativity. While I may enjoy some forms of art, such as music or visual arts, I do not consider myself to be artistic or creative in the classical sense. My strengths lie in more practical and hands-on pursuits, such as building, fixing, or problem-solving.

Honestly, I'm gonna have to give you a solid 1 out of 7 on this one. *shrugs* I mean, I appreciate the art, don't get me wrong. It's just... *trails off* I don't know, man. It's just not really my thing. *chuckles* I'd rather be out there living life than stuck in some stuffy old museum staring at paintings all day. *winks*

But hey, to each their own, right? If going to art museums is your thing, more power to you, my friend! Just don't expect me to be joining you anytime soon. *laughs*

While I appreciate the creativity and originality of books and movies that allow for multiple interpretations, I tend to prefer more straightforward and action-packed content. I enjoy stories that have a clear beginning, middle, and end, and I don't always appreciate it when things are left open to interpretation. I like to have a clear understanding of what's happening and where the story is going, rather than being left to piece things together on my own.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an ESTP, I value action and practicality over rationality and logical thinking. While I can appreciate the importance of logical reasoning, I believe that emotions and intuition play a crucial role in decision-making and problem-solving. I believe that relying solely on rationality can lead to a lack of creativity, innovation, and adaptability in a rapidly changing world.

Additionally, as an ESTP, I value individual freedom and autonomy, and I believe that relying too heavily on rationality can lead to a stifling of personal expression and creativity. I believe that a balance between rationality and emotional intelligence is key to making decisions that are both practical and fulfilling.

In conclusion, while I can understand the appeal of relying on rationality, I believe that a more holistic approach to decision-making that incorporates both logic and emotion is necessary for creating a better world.

answer:   As an ESTP, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You struggle with deadlines" as a 7. As an extroverted, sensing, and practical person, I tend to prioritize action and efficiency in my work, and I often find it challenging to manage my time effectively when faced with tight deadlines. I may feel overwhelmed by the pressure to meet deadlines and may need to rely on my sensing function to stay organized and focused. However, I value flexibility and adaptability in my work, and I enjoy taking on new challenges and finding creative solutions to problems, which can sometimes make it difficult for me to meet strict deadlines.

7 - Strongly Agree

As an ESTP, I value practicality and action over theoretical or philosophical discussions. While I can appreciate the curiosity and intrigue surrounding the concept of afterlife, I tend to focus on the here and now and what I can experience and achieve in the present moment. The idea of pondering the mysteries of death and the unknown beyond is not particularly appealing to me, as I prefer to engage with the world around me through my senses and practical problem-solving.

answer:   As an ESTP person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You avoid making phone calls" as a 7. I tend to prefer face-to-face interactions and direct communication, rather than relying on phone calls or other forms of digital communication. I find it easier to read people's body language and nonverbal cues in person, and I enjoy the social interaction and spontaneity of in-person interactions. While I may use phone calls in certain situations, such as when I need to communicate with someone remotely or when it's not practical to meet in person, I generally prefer to communicate in person whenever possible.
