answer:   As an ESFJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You know at first glance how someone is feeling" as a 7.

As a Feeling type, I have a natural ability to pick up on the emotions of others and to understand their feelings without needing to know all the details. I have a strong empathetic nature, and I am often able to sense how someone is feeling just by being around them. I find it easy to read people's body language and tone of voice, and I can often tell when someone is feeling upset or distressed.

So, the statement "You know at first glance how someone is feeling" accurately reflects my personality type and my ability to connect with others on an emotional level. I would agree with this statement to a high degree, as it is a fundamental aspect of my personality and something that I rely on to build strong relationships with others.

answer:   As an ESFJ person, I would rate the statement "Your personal work style is closer to spontaneous bursts of energy than organized and consistent efforts" as a 7, indicating that I strongly disagree with the statement.

As an ESFJ, I tend to be a very organized and consistent person, and I prefer to plan and schedule my work in advance. I enjoy breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps, and I feel most productive when I have a clear plan and timeline in place. While I do enjoy spontaneity and flexibility in my work, I find that having a structured approach helps me to stay focused and motivated.

In contrast, the statement suggests that my work style is more spontaneous and unpredictable, which is not entirely accurate. While I do enjoy taking on new challenges and adapting to changing circumstances, I find that having a clear plan and timeline helps me to stay on track and achieve my goals.

Overall, I would say that my work style is a mix of both spontaneity and organization, and I try to strike a balance between the two. While I do enjoy the occasional burst of energy and creativity

answer:   As an ESFJ person, I would rate the statement "You are very intrigued by things labeled as controversial" as a 7, fully agree. As an Extraverted Feeling Judging type, I tend to be drawn to and interested in topics that are labeled as controversial or unconventional, as they often involve complex emotions and perspectives that I can empathize with. I enjoy engaging in discussions and debates that challenge my views and help me understand different perspectives, and controversial topics often provide a rich source of material for this. My natural interest in the feelings and needs of others, combined with my desire to harmonize and accommodate, can sometimes lead me to seek out controversial topics as a way of connecting with others and finding common ground, even if it means exploring uncomfortable or unpopular opinions.

As an Extraverted Sensing Feeling Judging (ESFJ) person, I tend to be very in tune with my emotions and the emotions of those around me. I have a strong desire to connect with others and be in harmony with them, which can sometimes make me more susceptible to changes in mood. I also have a tendency to be very empathetic and can easily pick up on the emotions of those around me, which can sometimes make me feel like my mood is being influenced by those around me. So, I would agree with the statement "Your mood can change very quickly" to a high degree, as it is a characteristic that I am very familiar with.

As a Judging type, I value stability and security, and I believe that having a backup plan for a backup plan is essential to ensure that I am prepared for any unexpected events that may arise. I am always looking for ways to be prepared and to have a plan in place, even for things that may seem unlikely to happen. I understand the importance of being proactive and taking steps to mitigate potential risks, and having a backup plan for a backup plan is a key part of that.

When someone shows appreciation or admiration towards me, I tend to feel validated and accepted. However, I also have a tendency to worry about maintaining their approval and may feel anxious about potential disappointment or criticism.

answer:   As an ESFJ person, I would rate the statement "Your emotions control you more than you control them" as a 7 (strongly disagree). ESFJs are known for being empathetic and attuned to the emotions of others, but they also value control and stability in their own emotional experiences. They are unlikely to feel like their emotions are completely beyond their control, and may actually use their emotions to guide their decision-making and relationships.

answer:   As an ESFJ person, I would rate the statement "You are not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works" as a 5. While I appreciate the value of analyzing and interpreting creative works, I also enjoy engaging in discussions that allow me to understand different perspectives and share my own insights. I find it important to consider the context and intentions behind a work of art, and I enjoy exploring the emotions and themes it evokes. However, I also value efficiency and practicality in my interactions, and may not always have the time or energy to delve deeply into complex interpretations.

As an Extraverted Sensing Feeling Judging (ESFJ) person, I tend to be highly attuned to my surroundings and the moods of those around me. I am easily influenced by the emotions of others and can quickly pick up on changes in the atmosphere. This means that I am likely to be affected by the moods of those around me and may have a tendency to mirror their emotions. So, the statement "Your mood can change very quickly" would be a accurate reflection of my personality type.

answer:   As an ESFJ person, I would rate the statement "You believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time" as a 7, indicating that I strongly disagree with the statement. ESFJs are known for their practical and concrete approach to life, and they often prioritize tangible, real-world concerns over abstract philosophical ideas. While they may appreciate the value of philosophical inquiry in theory, they may not see the practical value in spending too much time pondering abstract questions that do not have a clear, immediate application in their lives.

While I may not always have personal experiences that are similar to those of others, I am able to use my active listening skills and emotional intelligence to understand and connect with people from diverse backgrounds and experiences.
