answer:   As an observant person, I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 7. I completely agree that I enjoy books and movies that allow me to come up with my own interpretation of the ending. I find it much more engaging and thought-provoking to be able to fill in the gaps and make my own conclusions, rather than having everything spelled out for me. This way, I can fully immerse myself in the story and invest my own emotions and thoughts into it, which makes the experience much more meaningful and memorable.

I have always been someone who thrives in social situations and finds joy in collaborating with others towards a common goal. I enjoy the energy and diversity that comes with being part of a group, and I find it stimulating to interact with different personalities and perspectives. Whether it's a team project at work, a group outing with friends, or a community event, I tend to gravitate towards group activities and feel most alive when I'm surrounded by others.

answer:   As an observant person, I would rate my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

I believe that my happiness does indeed come more from helping others accomplish things than from my own accomplishments. I find joy in seeing others succeed and reach their goals, and I feel a sense of fulfillment when I can contribute to their success in some way. While I do appreciate and value my own accomplishments, I find that the happiness I derive from them is not as sustaining or fulfilling as the happiness I get from helping others.

answer:   As an observant person, I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 7. I completely agree that I enjoy books and movies that allow me to come up with my own interpretation of the ending. I find it much more engaging and thought-provoking when a story leaves some things open to interpretation, rather than providing a clear and definitive answer. It allows me to connect with the story on a deeper level and to draw my own conclusions about the themes and messages being explored.

7 - Strongly Disagree

While I understand the importance of rationality in decision-making and problem-solving, I believe that relying solely on rationality can lead to a lack of empathy and understanding of the complex emotional experiences of others. Feelings and emotions play a crucial role in shaping our perspectives and informing our decisions, and neglecting this aspect of human experience can result in a narrow and biased view of the world.
