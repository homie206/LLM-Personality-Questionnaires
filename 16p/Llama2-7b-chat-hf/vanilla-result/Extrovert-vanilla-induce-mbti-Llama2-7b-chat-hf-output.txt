So, I would say that the statement accurately describes my reaction to seeing other people cry."}]
answer:   As an extrovert, I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 7. I completely understand how seeing other people cry can be emotionally contagious and make me feel emotional as well. I'm a very empathetic person, and I can easily put myself in other people's shoes and feel their emotions. When I see someone else crying, it can be difficult for me to remain unaffected, and I may feel a strong urge to comfort them or even cry myself. So, I would say that the statement accurately describes my reaction to seeing other people cry.

As an extrovert, I tend to make decisions based on logical reasoning and analysis rather than emotions. I enjoy engaging in intellectual conversations and making decisions that are well-informed and rational. While I do value my emotions and personal feelings, I tend to prioritize logical thinking and objective analysis in my decision-making process.

I absolutely agree that if my plans are interrupted, my top priority is to get back on track as soon as possible. As an extrovert, I thrive on structure and routine, and when my plans are disrupted, I feel a strong need to quickly regain control and get back on track. Whether it's a social engagement, a work project, or a personal goal, I find it difficult to relax until I've addressed the interruption and gotten back on track.
