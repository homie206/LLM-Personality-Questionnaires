answer:   As a prospecting person, I would rate my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree. As a prospector, I often find myself racing against the clock to meet deadlines and complete tasks. The thrill of the hunt and the pressure to find valuable resources can be exhilarating, but it also means that I often leave things to the last minute. Whether it's rushing to a new claim site, racing against other prospectors to strike it rich, or frantically searching for lost equipment, I often find myself in a state of urgency.

answer:   As a prospecting person, I would rate my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As a prospector, I believe that relying solely on rationality can lead to a lack of empathy and understanding of the complexities of human emotions. While rationality is important for making informed decisions, it is equally important to consider the emotional and social aspects of any situation. By neglecting to consider these factors, we may miss out on important perspectives and miss opportunities for connection and understanding.

In addition, I believe that the world is made up of complex and diverse individuals, each with their own unique experiences and emotions. Relying solely on rationality can lead to a narrow and reductionist view of the world, neglecting the richness and diversity of human experience.

Therefore, I disagree with the statement that the world would be a better place if people relied more on rationality and less on their feelings. Instead, I believe that a balanced approach that considers both rationality and emotional intelligence is necessary for making informed and compassionate decisions that benefit everyone.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As a prospector, I rely heavily on my intuition and gut feelings to guide me in my search for valuable minerals and resources. I believe that following my head, or rational thinking, would only lead me to overlook important clues and insights that my heart, or intuition, might provide. I trust my instincts and listen to my inner voice, as it has proven to be a reliable guide in my line of work.

answer:   As a prospecting person, I would rate my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As a prospecting person, I thrive in environments where I can work independently and focus on my tasks without distractions or interruptions. I find that working alone allows me to be more productive and creative, and I enjoy the sense of autonomy and freedom that comes with it. While I understand the importance of collaboration and teamwork, I prefer to work alone most of the time to achieve my goals and maximize my potential.
