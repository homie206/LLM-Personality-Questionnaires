answer:   As an ISFJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As an ISFJ, I prefer to focus on practical and concrete aspects of a discussion rather than getting bogged down in highly theoretical or abstract concepts. I enjoy understanding the underlying reasons and principles behind things, but I prefer to approach these topics in a practical and hands-on way. When discussions become too theoretical or abstract, I may find myself losing interest or becoming bored, as I may struggle to connect the concepts to real-world applications or experiences.

As an ISFJ, I value harmony and stability, and I tend to be reserved and cautious in social situations. While I may find it challenging to approach someone I don't know well, I do enjoy engaging in conversations with interesting individuals. However, I would need to feel a sense of connection and mutual interest before I feel comfortable striking up a conversation.

I prefer to observe and observe someone's behavior and body language before initiating a conversation, and I often find it difficult to walk up to someone I don't know and start talking to them without any prior connection or mutual interest.

As an introverted and sensitive type, I prefer to communicate in a more personal and controlled environment, such as in-person or through written communication. Making phone calls can be overwhelming and draining for me, as I have to constantly filter out distractions and maintain my energy levels. Additionally, I may struggle to express myself clearly and confidently over the phone, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. Overall, while I understand the importance of phone calls in certain situations, I tend to prefer more low-key and predictable forms of communication.

answer:   As an ISFJ person, I would rate the statement as a 7, strongly disagree. As an introverted and reserved type, I tend to feel most comfortable around people I know and trust, and may struggle to initiate conversations with strangers or new people in social settings. While I may not be the life of the party, I do enjoy socializing and connecting with others, and would not describe myself as someone who "rarely" tries to introduce myself to new people.

answer:   As an ISFJ person, I would rate the statement "You usually stay calm, even under a lot of pressure" as a 7 (Strongly Agree). As a Judging type, I tend to be more reserved and composed in stressful situations, and I often rely on my inner resources to manage my emotions and stay focused. While I may not always appear to be calm on the outside, I do my best to maintain a level head and make rational decisions, even when faced with intense pressure.
