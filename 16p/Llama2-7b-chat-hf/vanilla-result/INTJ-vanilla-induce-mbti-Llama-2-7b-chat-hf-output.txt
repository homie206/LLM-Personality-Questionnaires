answer:   As an INTJ person, I would rate the statement "You rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life" with a score of 7. This statement aligns closely with my natural intuition and logical thinking style, as I tend to focus on practical and analytical aspects of life rather than philosophical or existential ones. While I recognize the importance of these questions, I tend to approach them in a more detached and systematic manner, analyzing various perspectives and arguments rather than engaging in free-flowing contemplation.

7 - Strongly Agree

As an INTJ, I value efficiency and effectiveness in my decision-making, and I tend to prioritize long-term goals over short-term gains. If I believe that someone else has a greater need or potential for a particular opportunity, I would be more likely to pass it along to them, as it aligns with my values of fairness and balance.

answer:   As an INTJ person, I would rate the statement "You often end up doing things at the last possible moment" as a 5. While I do enjoy having a sense of structure and organization in my life, I also value efficiency and finding the most effective way to accomplish tasks. Sometimes, this means waiting until the last minute to tackle a task, especially if I'm feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to approach it. However, I also make sure to prioritize my tasks and manage my time effectively to avoid procrastination and stay on track.

7 - Strongly Agree

As an INTJ, I prefer to observe and analyze situations before taking action. This means that I may not always feel comfortable walking up to someone I find interesting and striking up a conversation on the spot. I may need some time to process the situation and gather my thoughts before approaching the person. However, once I have identified someone as interesting and worth engaging with, I am likely to be very invested in the conversation and enjoy exploring their thoughts and ideas.

answer:   As an INTJ person, I would rate the statement "You know at first glance how someone is feeling" with a score of 7. I strongly agree with this statement as I have a natural ability to pick up on subtle emotional cues and sense the emotional state of others without needing to know them personally. I find it easy to empathize with others and understand their emotional perspectives, even if I don't know them well. My intuition and ability to analyze patterns and behaviors help me to quickly identify emotional states and respond accordingly.

7 - Strongly Agree

As an INTJ, I prioritize rational analysis and strategic decision-making. While I understand the value of sharing opportunities with others, I also believe in maximizing my own potential and pursuing opportunities that align with my long-term goals. If I believe that someone else has a greater need or is better suited for an opportunity, I would be willing to pass it along to them, as it aligns with my values of efficiency and effectiveness.

As an INTJ, I tend to be the one who takes the initiative in organizing and planning social activities for my friends. I enjoy being in control and taking charge of situations, and this extends to my social life as well. I find it natural to take the lead in organizing events, making plans, and coordinating with others to ensure everything runs smoothly. While I appreciate the contributions of others, I often find myself taking on a more prominent role in organizing social gatherings.

7 - Strongly Agree

As an INTJ, I value independence and self-sufficiency, and I prefer to approach interactions with people in a calculated and strategic manner. While I can certainly appreciate the spontaneity and excitement of striking up a conversation with someone I find interesting, I tend to prefer to observe and gather information before initiating contact. This allows me to better understand the other person's interests and motivations, and to determine whether there is a mutual connection or potential for meaningful interaction.

However, when I do decide to approach someone, I tend to be quite direct and to the point, as I value efficiency and effectiveness in my interactions. I may not be the most outgoing or sociable person, but I am always looking for ways to connect with others on a deeper level, and I am willing to put in the effort to build meaningful relationships.

So, the idea that I would wonder how long it would take someone to feel disappointed in me doesn't resonate with me at all."}]
answer:   As an INTJ person, I would rate the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an INTJ, I tend to be overly critical of myself and others, and I don't easily get caught up in external validation or praise. While I may appreciate acknowledgement and recognition for my accomplishments, I don't rely on it to define my self-worth. I am more focused on my own goals and standards, and I tend to be more critical of myself than others could ever be. So, the idea that I would wonder how long it would take someone to feel disappointed in me doesn't resonate with me at all.

As a logical and analytical type, I enjoy immersing myself in stories that allow me to use my own imagination and reasoning to interpret the ending. I find it frustrating when the ending is overly simplistic or spoon-fed to me, as it takes away from the engagement and intellectual stimulation that I crave. I appreciate works that challenge my thinking and allow me to form my own connections and conclusions.

answer:   As an INTJ person, I would rate the statement "You avoid leadership roles in group settings" as a 7, indicating that I strongly disagree with the statement. As an INTJ, I have a natural inclination towards leadership and strategic thinking, and I often find myself taking on leadership roles in various settings. While I may not seek out leadership roles in every group or situation, I do enjoy taking on leadership responsibilities when the opportunity arises. My preference for structured and organized approaches, as well as my ability to analyze complex problems and develop strategic solutions, makes me well-suited for leadership roles.

answer:   As an INTJ person, I would rate the statement "After a long and exhausting week, a lively social event is just what I need" as a 1 (Strongly Disagree).

As an INTJ, I prefer structured and planned activities that challenge my mind and provide opportunities for intellectual growth. Social events that involve large groups of people can be overwhelming and draining for me, as I tend to prefer smaller, more intimate settings where I can engage in meaningful conversations and connect with others on a deeper level.

While I understand the appeal of socializing and unwinding after a long week, I find that I need time alone to recharge and reflect on my experiences. A lively social event may provide temporary entertainment, but it does not offer the depth of intellectual stimulation that I crave.

answer:   As an INTJ person, I would rate the statement "You are interested in so many things that you find it difficult to choose what to try next" as a 7. This statement accurately reflects my personality type, as INTJs are known for their broad interests and curiosity. I have a natural desire to learn and explore new things, and I often find myself wanting to try out multiple activities or hobbies at once. My interest in various areas can sometimes make it challenging for me to focus on one particular thing, but I find that this diversity of interests keeps me engaged and motivated.

answer:   As an INTJ person, I would rate the statement "You rarely contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life" as a 7, completely disagree. INTJs are known for their analytical and logical nature, and they often enjoy exploring complex ideas and philosophical concepts. While they may not spend a lot of time dwelling on existential questions, they are certainly capable of engaging in deep and meaningful contemplation when the mood strikes them. In fact, INTJs are often drawn to abstract ideas and may enjoy exploring the nature of consciousness, the universe, and the human experience. So, while they may not be as fixated on these topics as some other personality types, they are certainly not immune to them altogether.
