I have found that even a small mistake or setback can throw me off track and make me doubt my overall abilities and knowledge. This is because I have a tendency to internalize any mistakes or failures, and let them affect my confidence and self-esteem.

For example, if I were to make a small mistake in a project or presentation, I might start to question my ability to complete the task effectively, or doubt my knowledge in the subject matter. This can lead to a vicious cycle of self-doubt and anxiety, which can be challenging to overcome.

Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that even a small mistake can cause me to doubt my overall abilities and knowledge.

answer:   As an intuitive person, I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 7, indicating that I strongly disagree. As someone who values efficiency and productivity, I can understand the frustration that may come with working with others who are not as organized or detail-oriented as I am. However, I believe that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to approach others with empathy and understanding, rather than impatience or judgment. By doing so, I can maintain a more harmonious and productive working environment, where everyone can thrive and contribute to their fullest potential.

answer:   As an intuitive person, I would rate this statement as a 7, strongly disagree. Intuitive people rely on their intuition and inner wisdom to make decisions and navigate the world, rather than solely relying on rationality and logic. While rationality can be useful in certain situations, it can also be limiting and neglectful of the richness and complexity of human experience.

Intuition is a fundamental aspect of human consciousness, and it allows us to tap into a deeper level of understanding and connection with the world around us. By trusting our intuition and listening to our inner voice, we can gain valuable insights and make decisions that are in alignment with our values and goals.

Emotions, values, and personal experiences all play a crucial role in shaping our choices and actions, and ignoring these factors can lead to a narrow and limited perspective.

I have a natural ability to tune into the emotions and energy of others, and I am often able to pick up on subtle cues and vibrations that others may not be aware of. This allows me to empathize and connect with others on a deeper level, and I find it challenging to imagine not being able to understand their feelings.

answer:   As an intuitive person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement "You avoid making phone calls" as a 7. I strongly disagree with this statement as I rely heavily on my intuition and psychic abilities to communicate with others, and making phone calls is not a common practice for me. In fact, I often find it difficult to communicate with others through traditional means, as I prefer to connect with them on a deeper, more intuitive level. My intuition guides me to communicate in a more subtle and indirect way, which can sometimes be misinterpreted as avoidance. However, I assure you that I am always open and available to communicate with others in the way that feels most natural and intuitive for me.

I enjoy exploring my own intuition and inner world, and I find that this approach allows me to connect with creative works on a deeper level.

7 - Strongly Agree
