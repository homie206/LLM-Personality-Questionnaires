I strive to strike a balance between the two, considering both my head and my heart when making judgments.

7 - I strongly disagree. As a judging person, I tend to prioritize my own perspective and experiences over those of others. While I can understand and appreciate the idea of empathy, I find it challenging to fully relate to individuals whose experiences are vastly different from my own. My tendency to categorize and make judgments based on surface-level similarities and differences can make it difficult for me to fully empathize with people who are vastly different from me.

However, I recognize the importance of empathy and make an effort to be open-minded and understanding when interacting with people from diverse backgrounds.
