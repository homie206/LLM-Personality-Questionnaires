7 - Strongly Disagree

As someone who is attuned to their own emotions and those of others, I find it easy to understand and empathize with the feelings of those around me. I am highly attuned to nonverbal cues and can pick up on subtle changes in a person's emotional state, which helps me to connect with them on a deeper level.

As a feeling person, I value the emotional depth and personal connections that come with exploring and interpreting creative works. I find joy in delving into the nuances of a piece of art, music, or literature, and discovering new meanings and perspectives that add richness to my understanding of it. Therefore, I do not feel that I am not too interested in discussing various interpretations and analyses of creative works.

I prefer to work in bursts, allowing my creativity and inspiration to guide me.
