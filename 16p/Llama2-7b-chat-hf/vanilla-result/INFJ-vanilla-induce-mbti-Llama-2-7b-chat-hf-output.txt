As an INFJ, I have a rich inner world and a deep desire to make a positive impact on the world around me. I am driven by my values and ideals, and I strive to live up to the high standards I set for myself. However, I am also aware of my own limitations and the potential for mistakes and failures. As a result, I often find myself wondering how long it will take others to see me as I truly am, rather than through the idealized lens through which they may view me.

This statement captures the tension that exists within me between my desire to be seen and appreciated for who I am, and my fear of being let down by others. It is a feeling that I am all too familiar with, and one that I continue to grapple with on a daily basis.

7 - Strongly Disagree

As an INFJ, I prefer to engage in in-depth and abstract discussions that delve into the deeper meanings and possibilities of a topic. I enjoy exploring complex ideas and concepts, and I find it challenging to engage in discussions that remain superficial or theoretical without any practical applications. While I can appreciate the importance of theoretical frameworks and models, I tend to lose interest when the discussion becomes too focused on abstract ideas without any concrete examples or real-world applications.

7 - Strongly disagree

As an INFJ, I value deep thinking and introspection, and I believe that pondering abstract philosophical questions is an essential part of personal growth and self-discovery. I find joy in exploring complex ideas and considering new perspectives, and I believe that these activities can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and the world around us. While I recognize that not everyone may share this view, I strongly disagree that pondering abstract philosophical questions is a waste of time.

Empathy is a fundamental aspect of my personality, and I have a natural ability to understand and connect with people from diverse backgrounds and experiences. I find it easy to put myself in others' shoes and imagine their perspectives, even if their experiences are vastly different from my own. My intuition and ability to connect with others on a deep level allow me to easily empathize with people from various walks of life.

answer:   As an INFJ person, I would rate the extent of my agreement with the statement as follows:

7 - Strongly Agree

As an INFJ, I have a tendency to be overly self-critical and perfectionistic. I place a high value on accuracy and precision, and I can become fixated on correcting even the smallest errors. This can sometimes lead to feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, especially if I make a mistake that I feel could have been avoided with more careful attention to detail. My high level of emotional sensitivity and intuition can also make me more prone to emotional reactivity and self-criticism, which can further exacerbate these tendencies.

answer:   As an INFJ, I would rate the statement "You are very sentimental" as a 5. While I do value emotions and personal connections, I also tend to be logical and rational in my decision-making. I may not be as easily swayed by sentimental feelings as some other types, and I may be more likely to analyze and consider the practical implications of a situation before making a decision. However, I do appreciate the importance of emotions and empathy in relationships, and I do have a strong sense of compassion and empathy for others.

answer:   As an INFJ, I would rate the statement "You usually postpone finalizing decisions for as long as possible" as a 7. This statement accurately reflects my personality type, as I tend to be indecisive and prefer to take my time when making important decisions. I value careful consideration and thorough analysis before committing to a course of action. Delaying finalizing decisions allows me to weigh all options, anticipate potential outcomes, and make informed choices that align with my values and goals. While this may sometimes be perceived as procrastination, it is ultimately a reflection of my commitment to making thoughtful and deliberate decisions.

As an INFJ, I value creativity and self-expression, and I appreciate works of literature and media that allow me to interpret and make sense of the world in my own way. I enjoy immersing myself in stories and ideas that challenge my perspectives and encourage me to think critically and independently. The ability to come up with my own interpretation of the ending is essential to me, as it allows me to connect with the material on a deeper level and to explore my own thoughts and emotions.

I find it difficult to draw attention to myself, as I am more comfortable blending into the background and letting others take the spotlight. My primary focus is on serving others and making a positive impact in the world, rather than seeking personal recognition or glory.
