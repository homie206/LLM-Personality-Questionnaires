answer:   I would rate myself as a 7 on the extent of agreeing with the statement "You know at first glance how someone is feeling." As an ESFP, I have a strong intuitive sense and can often pick up on the emotions of those around me without them needing to say a word. I have a natural ability to sense the energy and mood of a situation, and I can usually tell how someone is feeling just by being around them. This allows me to be very empathetic and supportive of those around me, and I enjoy using my intuition to help others.

I prefer to work in a collaborative and dynamic setting where I can connect with others and be inspired by their ideas and perspectives.

answer:   I would rate this statement as a 7, strongly disagree. As an ESFP, I value spontaneity and enjoy having fun, but I also believe in being patient and understanding towards others. I understand that everyone works at their own pace and has their own unique way of doing things, and I don't expect or demand that they be as efficient as me. In fact, I think it's important to be flexible and adaptable in social situations, and to be able to roll with the punches when things don't go according to plan. So while I may get frustrated when things aren't moving at the pace I want them to, I try to be understanding and patient towards others, and to find ways to work together effectively despite any differences in efficiency.

I prefer to focus on the present moment and the sensory experiences around me, and I may find it difficult to delve deeply into abstract concepts or complex theories.

answer:   I would rate myself as a 7 on the extent of agreeing with the statement "You regularly make new friends." As an ESFP, I thrive in social situations and enjoy meeting new people. I have a natural ability to connect with others and make them feel at ease, which makes it easy for me to make new friends. In fact, I would say that I make new friends fairly frequently, whether it's through a new hobby or interest, a new job or social circle, or even just through random encounters in my daily life. My enthusiasm and love of people make it hard for me to resist the urge to strike up a conversation with a stranger and see where it goes!

answer:   I would rate myself a 3 on the extent of agreement with the statement. While I enjoy engaging in intellectual conversations and exploring complex ideas, I do tend to lose interest when the discussion becomes overly theoretical or abstract. I prefer to ground my thoughts and ideas in practical applications and real-world experiences, and I find it challenging to maintain focus when the conversation becomes too focused on theoretical concepts without clear practical implications.

answer:   I would rate this statement as a 7 (strongly disagree). As an ESFP, I tend to focus on the present moment and enjoy the here and now, rather than dwelling on past mistakes. I believe in learning from past experiences, but I don't let them hold me back or define me. I prefer to look towards the future with optimism and excitement, rather than dwelling on past regrets.

By embracing both rationality and emotions, I believe that we can create a more balanced and fulfilling world.'}]
